    "# Voltage stability in power systems\n",
    "This notebook will cover voltage stability in the power system, mainly focusing on the classical voltage stability and control of synchronous machines. However, the objectives and control concepts are often applicable in converter control as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voltage in synchronous generators\n",
    "In synchronous generators the voltage is determined by the induced emf of the generator $\\underline{E}$. This induced emf is determined by the excitation system of the windings in the generator. To control the voltage, we control this system through excitation control. This is generally referred to as an $AVR$. Lets take a closed look at the generator and components surrounding it in the figure below.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The excitation system has the following functions:\n",
    "- Provide direct current to the machine field windings\n",
    "- Control of voltage and reactive power flow\n",
    "- Enhancement of system stability\n",
    "- Protective functions ensure that the capability limits of\n",
    "the synchronous machine, excitation system and other\n",
    "equipment are not exceeded\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we clearly see how the voltage of the generator and the excitation system is connected. The question then becomes how do we effectivly control this system? We control the system based on the on the control objectives, which can be summarized as \n",
    "- Maintain desired voltage / reactive power\n",
    "- Voltage quality\n",
    "- System stability\n",
    "- Reactive power allocation/sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that maintaining desired voltage does not always mean a constant voltage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to effectivly design the regulators, we first need a model of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. order linearized model and the voltage loop\n",
    "The system in the previous figure, is a complex system consisting of multiple mechanical and electrical components, each contributing with their own dynamics. When modeling and studying this system, simplifications must be made. One of the most effective simplifications done when modeling this system is looking at linearized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will look at the 3. order linearized model, consisting of three internal variables; speed/freq. $\\Delta \\omega$, voltage $\\Delta E_f$ and rotor angle $\\Delta \\delta$. In this model, different parts of the power plant is modelled as linear transferfunctions in the laplace domain. By doing this we can describe the dynamics of the different components, and how they effect each other and the output. The 3. order model is a fairly simple model, and higher order models are often used to emulate the system more realistically (such as the 6. order model used in tops). The figure below shows the the 3. order linearized model. \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the model, the dynamics of the system is interconnected, and the voltage loop is coupled with the frequency and angle loops. This complicates the design and analysis of controllers for the system, such as the AVR. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this, we consider a property of the system; time-scales. The voltage loop is a fast acting loop, while the frequency is often slow in comparison. Assuming this, we can decouple the system by assuming the connection gains between the loops to be negligible, i.e. $K_2, K_4, K_5 \\approx 0$. By doing this we can extract the decoupled voltage loop as seen in the figure below. Keep in mind, this is an assumption and can impact the quality of the analysis if the time-scales are not sufficiently separated. \n",

    "Automatic Voltage Regulators is an integral part of the power system. The AVR plays a key role in modern power system’s ability to react to faults, sudden changes of load and generation conditions. The AVR controls the excitation current to the synchronous generator. Since reactive power is produced in the generator, the AVR can increase or decrease the excitation current and thereby control the reactive power output from the generator. Controlling the reactive power is essential to maintain voltage levels within limits in the grid.\n",
    "### Modeling an AVR\n",
    "From using tops, you might have recognized some different AVR types in the models like SEXS or IEEE Type 1 or 2. The IEEE type 1 is similar to a PI regulator and type two close to a PID regulator.
